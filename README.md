# Worked All OARC

## tl;dr

A fun contest aiming to bring members of OARC together through radio.

## What does this notebook do?

1. Reads the QSO submissions from the Google Form via a Google Sheet
2. Imports into a pandas dataframe
3. Cleans the callsign and validates it is a valid DXCC (and spits out rows to check for errors)
4. Plots some basic statistics / graphs and Leaderboards
